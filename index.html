        <h1>Sacrifice</h1>
      <body>
        <p>This game is based off of the religious laws of Ancient Greek Paganism, specifically the requirement that sacrifices
        be made to the Gods. The law dictates that people shall give sacrifices to the Gods, sometimes in small things like fruit
        or wine, but other times animal sacrifices would be required. These sacrifices often took place during celebrations in the
        Gods honor. These sacrifices appease the Gods by demonstrating the devoutness and loyalty of their followers, the more 
        pleased the Gods the greater the rewards.
        </p>
        <p>The game would begin with Hermes, the messenger God, appearing the tell the player (an Ancient Greek woman) that the
        Gods are displeased with her city's lack of piousness. He declares that if the player cannot appease the Gods with sacrifices
        within the next three days their city will be destroyed by Zeus. The player would collect items and deliver them to an altar,
        either appeasing the Gods or incurring their wrath.
        </p>
